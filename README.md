I've spent the past few days developing landing pages. What makes this project different is the fact that I used javascript to ensure that the navbar becomes fixed after the page is scrolled past a certain height. I also incorporated an option of moving back to the top of the webpage on the click of a "top-link" I designed with css animation. So basically, I picked up css animation and also got to flex my javascript skills.
I would like to appreciate frontend mentor for providing the files used in this project
